# Azure Resource Management Scripts

I've taken some of the cool stuff I've built (or played with) for managing Microsoft Azure with Python, cleaned them up, and now Iâ€™m throwing them out into the wild for all of you.

## Features

- Authentication using Azure CLI credentials.
- Listing available Azure subscriptions.
- Selection of Azure subscriptions for operations.
- Creation and deletion of Azure resource groups with specified names and locations.
- Verifies the non-existence of resource groups before creation to avoid conflicts.
- YOLO mode for bypassing confirmation steps in resource management operations.
- Configurable through a JSON file for automated setups.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.12
- Azure CLI installed and configured with `az login`.
- Installation of required Python libraries: `azure-identity`, `azure-mgmt-resource`, and `rich`.

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-resource rich

```

## Usage

    Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
    Ensure you have configured the config.json file as per your requirements.
    Run the script using Python:
```bash
python SetUpAndTakeDown.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to authenticate, select subscriptions, and manage resource groups.
